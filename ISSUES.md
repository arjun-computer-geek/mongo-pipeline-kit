# Issue Management Guide

This guide helps you understand how to report issues, request features, and get support for mongo-pipeline-kit.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Check Documentation**: Review the [README.md](README.md) and [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md)
2. **Search Existing Issues**: Use the search bar to find similar issues
3. **Check Previous Questions**: Look for similar questions in existing issues

### Issue Types

We have three main types of issues:

- üêõ **Bug Reports**: Something isn't working as expected
- üöÄ **Feature Requests**: Suggest new functionality
- ‚ùì **Questions**: Ask for help or clarification

## üêõ Reporting Bugs

### What to Include

- **Clear Description**: What happened vs. what you expected
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Environment Info**: Node.js, MongoDB, OS versions
- **Code Example**: Minimal code that reproduces the issue
- **Error Messages**: Full error stack traces

### Bug Report Template

````markdown
## Bug Description

Brief description of the issue

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Install mongo-pipeline-kit@0.3.0
2. Run this code:

```typescript
import { PipelineBuilder } from "mongo-pipeline-kit";
const builder = new PipelineBuilder().match({ status: "active" });
```
````

3. See error: [paste error here]

## Expected vs Actual

- Expected: Pipeline should build successfully
- Actual: Throws TypeError

## Environment

- mongo-pipeline-kit: 0.3.0
- Node.js: 18.0.0
- MongoDB: 6.0
- OS: macOS

````

## üöÄ Feature Requests

### What to Include

- **Problem Statement**: What problem does this solve?
- **Proposed Solution**: How should it work?
- **Use Cases**: Real-world examples
- **Impact**: Who benefits and how much?

### Feature Request Template

```markdown
## Feature Description
Add support for pipeline templates

## Problem Statement
Users often create similar pipelines and have to copy-paste code

## Proposed Solution
Add a template system where users can save and reuse common pipeline patterns

## Use Cases
```typescript
// Template: User Analytics
const userAnalyticsTemplate = PipelineBuilder.template('user-analytics', {
  match: { status: 'active' },
  group: { _id: '$category', count: { $sum: 1 } }
});

// Usage
const pipeline = userAnalyticsTemplate.build();
````

## Impact

- High priority for advanced users
- Medium complexity
- Benefits all users who create similar pipelines

## ‚ùì Asking Questions

### What to Include

- **Clear Question**: What are you trying to achieve?
- **What You've Tried**: Show your attempts
- **Code Example**: Your current implementation
- **Expected Outcome**: What you want to happen

### Question Template

```markdown
## Question
How do I export a pipeline to JSON with custom metadata?

## What I've Tried
I tried using `builder.toJSON()` but it doesn't include metadata

## Code Example
```typescript
const builder = new PipelineBuilder()
  .match({ status: 'active' })
  .group({ _id: '$category', count: { $sum: 1 } });

// I want to add metadata like description, author, etc.
const json = builder.toJSON(); // This doesn't include metadata
````

## Expected Outcome

I want to export the pipeline with additional information like:

- Description
- Author
- Version
- Tags

```
